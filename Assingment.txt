Integrate the Star Wars API as follows:

Page 1:
Create a form with three buttons, "Pull People/Characters", "Pull Films" and "Save Data".
Data pulled from API should be displayed bellow form.
On click of "Save Data", pulled data should be inserted into our laravel system database
Submitted entries should be listed in a table format on the same page
Every point mentioned above should be completed without page refresh

Page 2:
Show the list of films and people/characters pulled from the API.
On click of film, list of people/characters acted (only if our database has that entry) in the film should be displayed
On click of people/character name, list of films s/he acted (only if our database has that entry) should be displayed
